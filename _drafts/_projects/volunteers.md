**Volunteers**

Volunteers add enormous value to what we are trying to achieve at St Michael’s. Our mission is to work alongside the girls, staff and community and help them to achieve a positive outcome to support themselves and their family, and hopefully live a fulfilling life.  This takes time and patience trying to understand their needs, seeing how we can help, and then supporting them and encouraging them along the way. We are not a Gap Year Company with volunteers at the school all the time. So when volunteers want to go to St Michael’s they are immediately aware that their time there will be special and the girls will be really excited.  The ratio of teachers to pupils is very high - so extra pairs of hands are very welcome. Whether it is helping the teacher in class, in the library listening to reading, teaching in the computer room, organising games, painting walls, or even laying some bricks at Bishop Willigers joining the Uganda community volunteers to encourage them that we are all in this together....we really feel that volunteering at this amazing school with these amazing girls is life changing....our volunteers agree. 

 

We have an Information Pack about volunteering, and what to expect.  Fill in the Contact Form if you would like more information - telling us a bit about yourself.
