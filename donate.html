<p class="lead">We are Friends of St Michael's Uganda. Our mission is to provide for a girls' school and the local community in a remote part of Uganda, but we cannot do it alone. If you don't have the time to get involved, a donation is greatly appreciated and goes a long way to securing the girls' future. What's more, with online payments you can do it from the comfort of your sofa!</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Give monthly</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Giving a small amount each month won't break the bank and gives us a steady income to support ongoing projects.</p>

    <p>Your donation will directly benefit the school. The School Management Committee use the money for specific projects around the school that we support - such as the <a href="http://fsmu.co.uk/projects/school-lunch-feeding-programme-2/">School Lunch Feeding Programme</a>, malaria testing and treatment and salaries of the School Nurse, Librarian, IT Teacher, Farm Manager and more. Excellent accountability and feedback is done by the school management every term.</p>

    <p>Volunteers who have a specific skill that would enhance the education of the girls sometimes need financial help towards funding their trip, and specified donations go towards their expenses. These trips generally happen 3-4 times a year and there's always news to be bought back!</p>

    <p>Some equipment and resources are generously donated to the charity such as <a href="http://fsmu.co.uk/projects/computing/">laptops</a>, books and the projector, and our volunteers carry as much as they are able. However, we always need to fund ongoing expenses such as medicines, printer cartridges, essentials for the orphans (bedding, clothing, pens and exercise books) and mosquito nets.</p>

    <p>We also need to raise money for bigger building projects. We are currently fundraising for a complete renovation of the teachers' village within the school grounds. In order for St. Michaels to attract good quality teachers it is essential to offer them acceptable accommodation. The school needs to attract and keep the very best teachers and it is a challenge until we have the funds to renovate the existing housing, and add more facilities.</p>
