Well done and many many congratulations to Jamie Beach for completing and finishing the Bath Half in aid of FSMU. The weather was a contrast from last year when it was too warm, this year it was cool to say the least - good running weather.

Jamie raised over £500 by his efforts - a big thankyou - and it will go towards the School Lunch Feeding Programme. This programme is aimed at providing proper nutrition for the pupils and you can find more details on this website.

Last year a group of ten runners from St Michael’s Church, Bath ran for our charity, and this year it was Jamie. Do you feel inspired or motivated to run in the 2014 Bath Half in aid of St. Michael's?
