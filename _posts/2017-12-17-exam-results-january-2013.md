St. Michael's continued with its excellent examination record when the results came out in January. P7 (class Primary 7) achieved 24 Grade 1 results and 14 Grade 2 results. With these top grades any pupil will be able to go to a Secondary School of her choice - but only if her parents can/are willing to pay fees unless the pupil has secured a place in a rare state funded secondary school. As always it seems that the school excels in these examinations which are nation wide.
