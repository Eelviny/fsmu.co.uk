The Boys' Dorm Project is hosting a barn dance event with live music, dancing and an included meal! We encourage anyone to bring themselves and their family to our all-ages night of fun where we will be playing traditional Gaelic folk music in a ceilidh. No dancing skills required - just bring yourself, a hat and we'll coordinate your dancing. We'll be serving a meal halfway through the evening to keep you going and special family ticket prices to get everyone through the door. All the details for the event can be found on the barn dance page!
