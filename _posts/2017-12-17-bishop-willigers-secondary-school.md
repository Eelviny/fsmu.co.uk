_Bishop Willigers is a secondary school, located next door to St Michael's and a few minutes walk down the road._

We are really pleased that Bishop Willigers Senior School continues to grow—A huge thank you to Morriston Rotary Club in Swansea for helping in so many ways to get this school “off the ground”. The big news is that in May 2016 the school received Exam Centre status. This will mean that the students can now take their National Examination (equivalent to GCSEs) at BW rather than having to travel daily to another Exam Centre several kms away. Within the next twelve months the school needs to build two classrooms to accommodate students not taking exams, to keep the UNEB happy, even if it just four walls and a roof, left unplastered with a dirt floor. Kennedy the Headmaster is striving to mobilise the community to volunteer their time and donate bricks.

There is still a long way to go! - and we are looking for donors to support us with this venture.
