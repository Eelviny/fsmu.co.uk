I recently had the privilege of visiting St Michaels School in Busembatia, Uganda. I had visited Africa before so was familiar with some aspects of African culture. This was my first visit to Uganda and I was immediately struck by the beauty of the country and the friendliness of the people. It is difficult to describe exactly what is so special about St Michaels School , it may be the commitment of the staff, it may be the warmest welcome from the pupils, equally it could be the good will which inhabits the school generally, whatever it is, it is catching! To be able to share in the life of the school, not just an observer, is a truly life changing experience and one which IÂ  recommend to anyone who wants that kind of experience. I shall return to St Michaels in the future to experience once more that wonderful friendship and community rarely found in our busy lives today. If you are considering becoming a supporter of, or volunteer for St Michaels, you will not be disappointed.
