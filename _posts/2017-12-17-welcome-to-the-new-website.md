If you haven't heard of me already, my name's Elvin Luff and I've been working quietly behind the scenes with Nick and Vicki for a while now. I'm a 17 year old web designer from Wiltshire and this website is something that I've been working on since the start of this year, and I hope you like it!

I've done extensive work on tidying up the website in general, recategorising information and giving it this new look which I hope you will agree brings the website up with the times. From now on, I will be working on the overall website changes and updates, while Nick Beach will be working on the writing and content, such as blog posts (I won't be doing very many of these).

The idea behind my initial design philosophies is to split up the information - Give a brief overview, while still allowing the reader to dive in to read about everything in more detail. Also, I've worked on updating the photos throughout the site and there are many pictures to view in the gallery!

If you have any feedback or suggestions for the site, feel free to drop a comment below. It's always appreciated.
