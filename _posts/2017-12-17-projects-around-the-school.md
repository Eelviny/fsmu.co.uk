There are now hand washing stations around the school. The girls fill the tanks twice a day, but with over 600 pairs of hands using them they empty very quickly. So although they have been a success this project will need to be improved and monitored throughout 2015.

There are drinking water stations all around the school and in every dormitory. Again these drinking stations empty very quickly. So visitors from the UK have been saving empty bottles and now every girl has a bottle she takes to class. We have had educational workshops for staff and pupils run by local health workers pressing home the important of hand washing and hydration.

There is still some way to go to ensure that the girls drink an adequate amount of water every day. Nurse Jude is working hard to ensure that every girl is hydrated. The making of washable sanitary pads is in full production and has made a real difference to class attendance for older girls and female staff. We have slowly been able to take out wonderful old Singer Sewing Machines (they weigh 13kg each!!) We love these machines they are just so robust and keep on going despite little fingers fiddling.

The girls still forget that there are no optional ways of threading sewing machines...there is only one way. So when the stitching goes crazy it is always down to the girls being creative with the threading and thinking they can get the machine to work. The girls are now following a short course to learn basic hand stitches. On completion of the samples they were able to make bags to take home.
