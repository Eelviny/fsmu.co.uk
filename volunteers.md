**Volunteers**

Volunteers add enormous value to what we are trying to achieve at St Michael’s. Our mission is to work alongside the girls, staff and community and help them to achieve a positive outcome to support themselves and their family, and hopefully live fulfilling lives.  This takes time and patience trying to understand their needs, seeing how we can help, and then supporting them and encouraging them along the way. We are not a Gap Year Company with volunteers at the school all the time. So when volunteers want to go to St Michael’s they are immediately aware that their time there will be special and the girls will be really excited.  The ratio of teachers to pupils is very high - so extra pairs of hands are very welcome. Whether it is helping the teacher in class, in the library listening to reading, teaching in the computer room, organising games, painting walls, or even laying some bricks at Bishop Willigers joining the Uganda community volunteers to encourage them that we are all in this together....we really feel that volunteering at this amazing school with these amazing girls is life changing....our volunteers agree.

Sophie Turner's testimonial -

_The whole experience was amazing. At first it took me a while to adapt to the simple living of being in a developing country. However, the love and hospitality of the staff made this transition bearable and a fantastic experience.<!--more-->_

_All of the teachers were lovely and conversed with us regularly which was lovely. It was nice to discuss the differences between England and Uganda. The pupils were lovely although some minor problems with discipline in relation to the children turning up/doing the work required when in the classes. As a majority it was lovely to teach them and have fun with them outside of the classroom when they were not studying. I enjoyed sewing with them and doing arts/crafts and sports. It was lovely to be invited to experience their daily living also, for example helping with supper and going to the gardens. The children were very protective of us and would carry our things at any opportunity if we would have allowed it! When we were in the gardens they were reluctant to allow us to help/dig in case we hurt ourselves. It was nice to be so looked after and respected in this way. All of the staff and children were friendly and looked after us well which led to it being a very positive experience. The suggestions we made and resources we took out were gratefully received and incorporated where it was possible. This made me feel very valued. It was lovely to spend time with all members of the school and be included with daily runnings of the school._
