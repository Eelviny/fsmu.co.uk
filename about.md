#### Background to the Charity

Friends of St. Michael's was registered with the Charities Commission in 2009. Fiona, a Trustee, had a successful and formative time at St. Michael’s in her Gap Year in 2002. She returned to the school every year and started the building of the library. Other visits followed by members of her family and friends -  all being moved by the love and friendship they received, and the drive and desire to do something to help.

Bishop Willigers Secondary School is next door to St. Michael’s. To encourage transition from primary to secondary and help support the parents it was felt necessary to encompass Bishop Willigers and the immediate community into our charitable aims.</p>

<p>The charity is education and welfare-focused -  To advance the education and welfare of the 600+children at St. Michael's, the building and development of Bishop Willigers Secondary School (100 pupils)  and to help the immediate community - the village of Namunyumya. As a small charity with no overheads, such as salaries or rent, we are able to ensure that all donations go to where they are needed.</p>

<p>At least 2 of the trustees travel out separately on an annual basis to oversee the various projects, sleeping at St. Michael's  and getting involved with school life. </p> </div> </div>

#### How We Work

We are a small “kitchen table” UK registered charity. By this we mean we have no premises, only our own homes, and no equipment except that which we use in our everyday lives. Our trustees all volunteer their time and experience.

At least 2 of the trustees travel to Namunyumya to oversee the projects every year and all donations are used in support of our Charitable Objectives. We feel strongly that all money given to the charity goes to help the schools and and the village of  Namunyumya.

We work closely with St Michael’s and the other village schools, staff, parents and school management and the village of Namunyumya to ensure that all money and gifts are being spent wisely and on projects that are sustainable.

Communication with the schools and community takes place frequently. In this way our support can be focused, relevant and up to date.

Here in the UK the charity is managed by the 6 trustees who meet regularly.

### About St. Michael's School

{: #about-the-school}

St Michael’s is a girls’ primary school in a desperately poor area of rural Uganda 88 miles to the east of Kampala. It plays a vital role in the community and achieves excellent examination results but needs our help to thrive and develop.

The school was founded in 1962 by the Mill Hill Fathers under the leadership of Sister Mary John of the Order of the Little Sisters of St. Francis. The Headmistress and her predecessors have all belonged to the Little Sisters of St. Francis which is a Franciscan Order.

The school became Government-aided in 1967 which means that the day girls receive a free education until Secondary School. However the grant for resources and text books from the Government is very limited  – about £1 per child per annum! This level of provision results in quite often a lack of even the most basic essentials and low staffing levels.

Primary schooling finishes after 7 years with National Exams determining whether a child can progress to Secondary School.  But schooling after this level is not free for the overwhelming majority of pupils, so this is where education ends for many of the children in Uganda.

St. Michael’s admits girls irrespective of religion, tribe, colour or political affiliation. There are about 600 girls and 12 boys, some of whom are orphans who have been given food and shelter by the school. Most are day girls but there are about 250 boarders.

Uganda’s population - if left unchecked- is set to rise from 42 million to 102 million by 2050! Educated girls in Uganda have on average 2.9 children as opposed to 6.5 children born to uneducated girls. So girls' education is VITAL.

The commitment of the Charity is to continue to support this remarkable school where happiness, joy and love do co-exist with extreme poverty and deprivation. Education is the key for these girls to unlock the door to their potential.
