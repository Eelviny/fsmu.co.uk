St. Michaelâ€™s Primary School, Busembatia, Uganda is a government aided school about 88 miles from Kampala and situated in a remote and rural area.

There are about 600 girls and 12 boys, both boarding and day scholars. Most come from desperately poor backgrounds and some are orphans who are given food and shelter by the school.

The charity to support the school was created in 2009 as a means of providing on-going support both practical and financial to this little loving community although our commitment had started a few years earlier.

Notwithstanding the fact that the school is government aided the facilities are extremely basic. Despite the difficulties however the staff show remarkable commitment and the school is a place of happiness.
