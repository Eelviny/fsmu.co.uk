St. Michaelâ€™s Primary School, Busembatia, Uganda is a government aided school about 88 miles from Kampala and situated in a remote and rural area.

There are 600+ girls, both boarding and day scholars. Most come from desperately poor backgrounds and some are orphans who are given food and shelter by the school.

The charity was established in 2009 to provide on-going support, both practical and financial, to this amazing community.

Although the school is government aided the facilities are extremely basic. Despite the financial challenges everyone shows remarkable commitment and the school is a place of great happiness.  The staff work tirelessly to try and give each child an excellent education...... and a happy childhood.
