The School Lunch Feeding Programme started in 2008, with the aim to give all day girls a bowl of porridge. Within a year we were able to give all the 500 day girls a bowl of maize porridge each day at school.

This small meal makes a significant difference. Too many of the girls came to school without having breakfast - some having walked a long distance. They would have nothing to eat until they returned home in the late afternoon.

Results since starting the feeding programme:

* **Better concentration in class**
* **Improved attendance**
* **Better exam results**
* **Staff are able to carry out their teaching more effectively**

Our charity was formed to start up and fund this project and it will always be our main focus. We are working with the staff and parents encouraging them to play an active part.

We are also funding School Lunches at Bishop Willigers Secondary School.

We have also started the funding of School Lunches for 400 children at St. Mulumba's Primary School (next door to St Michael's) 

### Evaluation of the Feeding Programme and moving forward

In August 2011, an Oxford graduate volunteered at the school and undertook an in depth nutritional assessment of a sample group of 100 girls (a mix of boarders and day girls). She was satisfied that our School Lunch Feeding Programme supported the day girls in an appropriate way and was sustainable.

However, it is clear that we now need to also focus on the nutritional needs of the boarders and orphans at the school. The school has a very small budget to feed the boarders, and no money for feeding the orphans, until we started to help support the orphans.

The drought and the continuing food shortages in East Africa have impacted the school as the cost of basic food items have rocketed in price.

We aim to work in partnership with the school on how we support them – and it will be in a number of ways – through education so that they understand the importance of a varied diet and to help fund the purchase of crops for the school garden and introduction of Moringa.
