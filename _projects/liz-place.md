In 2010 Lizzie Beach-MacGeagh, daughter and sister of two of our trustees, was killed by a hit and run driver in London.  Lizzie loved Uganda and spent two happy visits at the school and was in the process of planning another trip after University.

So many of her friends and family knew how much she loved the girls at St. Michael's. Building a 4 bed Medical Centre in the grounds of the school has brought much joy and peace from such an unbearable tragedy - Lizzie’s lasting legacy - caring for the girls and saving many lives.

We fund a broad spectrum of medical supplies and medicines. Also the salary of one of the two full time resident nurses. Malaria testing and fast drug treatment is essential to save lives.  Some terms there are over 100 girls testing positive for malaria (each Malaria Testing Kits costs about 70p) and these girls need immediate treatment with ACT drugs.

Uganda has some of the highest recorded malaria transmission rates on the continent. **Malaria is Africa’s leading cause of mortality in children**.
