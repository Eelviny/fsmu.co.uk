In June 2010 Lizzie Beach-MacGeagh, daughter and sister of two of our trustees, was killed by a hit and run driver in London.  Lizzie loved Uganda and spent two happy visits at the school and was in the process of planning another trip after University.

Lizzie was just about to start her final year at Bristol University, reading History and had successfully got a PR internship with fashion house Moschino during the summer of 2010.

So many of her friends and family knew how much she loved St Michael’s, and building a Sick Bay in her memory in the grounds of the school has brought much happiness from such an unbearable tragedy - Lizzie’s lasting legacy has become caring for and saving lives.

Along with the Sick Bay we have also recruited a full time nurse for the school, which is paid for by donations, and we also fund the cost of important medicine and life-saving Malaria Testing Kits, which cost 70p per test.

Uganda has the third-highest death rate from malaria in Africa and some of the highest recorded malaria transmission rates on the continent. **Malaria is Africa’s leading cause of mortality in children**. Therefore catching the symptoms early can be live saving.
