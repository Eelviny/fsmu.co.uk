As a charity we are much more focused on the needs of the child rather than building work - but it is inevitable that from time to time we need to do renovations or build something new. We are particularly proud of Lizâ€™s Place, the Medical Centre, and the building of a large Washroom that has significantly reduced the cases of candida (thrush). With so many girls at the school it is inevitable that latrines need repairs, and taps on water stations need replacing and we respond to the requests from the School Management Committee particularly when health, safety or the welfare of the child is at risk.
