The gardens at the school have been developed thanks to a grant from Seeds for Africa.

The school has now been able to grow pineapples, mangoes, orange trees, avocado and lots more.

This will take time to develop and the hope is for the girls to reap the benefit by helping to work in the garden and in turn enjoy the nutritional benefit of the fruit.

We hope to extend the land and grow more fruit and vegetables, and eventually grow food which will be season all year round and which can help feed the girls on a more regular basis.
