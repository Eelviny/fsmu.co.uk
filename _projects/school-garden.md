It has been a challenge for us to know how best to support the School Gardens/Farm. There is a good amount of land at the school, and other land close by available to rent. We fund the salary of a Manager to oversee the workers in the gardens and farm.  The common aim between the School Management Committee and Friends of St Michael’s is that we want the gardens and farm to be a centre of excellence - a place of learning and a Demonstration Garden/Farm for the community. There have been several severe droughts and of course these have an impact on the next growing season. We will continue to support and press for improvements, but in reality there will be several years of work ahead of us to achieve this goal.
