We now have an increasing number of orphans at the school, currently 40 in total. Although the school is not an orphanage, there is a current problem in the fact that all nearby orphanages have reached or gone over their capacity, leaving these orphans without nowhere to go. So, in order to help, St Michael's has taken them in so as to give them a place to live and learn.

The school receives no money to help support these children, and is completely reliant on funds they receive to pay for their uniforms, food and other basic items.

In 2011 we created an Orphan Fund which meant we were able to immediately send money out to the Headmistress to buy bedding, uniform and some basic toiletries for them.

The Orphan Fund does not support individual orphans, but all orphans at St Michael’s School.

The children live at the school, St Michael’s is their home and they are looked after by the Sisters in the convent during the holidays.
