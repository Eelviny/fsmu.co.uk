We now have an increasing number of orphans at the school.  UNICEF states that there are over 2 million orphans in Uganda ! 

The school receives no money to help support these children, and is reliant on funds they receive from us and kindhearted Ugandans to pay for their uniforms, food and other basic items.

In 2011 we created an Orphan Fund. Some donors ask that their regular giving helps the headmistress to buy essentials for these children. The Orphan Fund does not support individual orphans, but all orphans during their time at St Michael’s.

Some children live at the school, St Michael’s is their home and many are looked after by the Rev. Sisters in the convent during the school holidays.
