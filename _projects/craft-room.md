The Sewing/Craft Room was built and equipped in 2011 to teach girls who are interested basic sewing skills to repair their uniform and clothing and to start to learn how to make their own clothes. Only a small number of the girls that attend St Michaelâ€™s will go on to secondary school. This is an opportunity to give these girls who will be dropping out of education a skill to take with them when they return to their homes.

The craft room has 8 hand-powered sewing machines (the old Singer sewing machine type) and the charity funds the salary of Solivia -  the very talented seamstress, who not only makes the uniform for the children but also runs the many sewing/craft clubs, with the help of teachers. 

### Sanitary Pads

Many of the girls do not come to school when they have their periods, as they do not have pads, which means they miss out on school. It is possible to make reusable sanitary pads from micro fleece and velcro - some pads were made last term and tested by a group of day girls. These have been very successful, and the sewing room now has plenty of fabric to make more.

### Donate Craft Material
