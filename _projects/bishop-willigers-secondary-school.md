With many thousands of children in the sub-county it is really important that we continue to support the development of Bishop Willigers Secondary School - next to St Michaelâ€™s. There are already 300 pupils in the 4 year groups - and as funds allow and building work continues the number of students will increase. Throughout Uganda the dropout rate through the 11 years of education from Primary 1 through to Senior 4 is alarming and we will do everything we can to ensure that as many children as possible from the village have the opportunity to continue with their education after P7.

The school is now grant aided (teachers on the government payroll).

There is a long way to go - and we are looking for donors to support the development of Bishop Willigers School.
