**Nursery**

The government wants Nursery education in every Primary School. There is no government funding to help and parents need to pay fees for these 3 years. With little guidance and training in Early Childhood Development this has brought many challenges.

The St. Michael’s Nursery opened in 2015 using the School Dining/Examination Hall - There are now 110 children - but at the moment only 4 teachers.

Very few of the parents manage to pay the full 45,000 UGX/term which includes lunch - (£10) - but some parents are able to pay little by little when they can.

In 2017 with financial help and volunteers from East African Playgrounds a playground was built for all the pupils at St Michael’s - and this has been a wonderful addition for the Nursery children to enjoy - All our long term volunteers now spend time in the Nursery helping to make educational resources.  This extra help means that the children can work into smaller groups doing fun hands on activities appropriate for their age.
