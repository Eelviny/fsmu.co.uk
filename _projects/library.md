Work started on building the Library in 2002, when Trustee Fiona Beach-MacGeagh started the foundation for the building after her Gap Year. Following many years and the help of other volunteers, the Library was completed in 2007.

With the help of AirBus and a shipping container, we were able to get over 70 boxes of books shipped to the school, all through donations. It was a huge success, and for the first time children at the school were able to read books independently.

St Francis School in Pewsey has been funding the cost of a dedicated Librarian for the school. This ensures that the library is kept in good order, as well as supporting the girls with their reading and running reading group.

As for many children and teachers in the school, English is not the first language, so the importance for accurate and easy to access reading materials for all levels of reading will be of huge importance and a great help to their English skills. Therefore having the resource of the Library will give all of the children a head start in future education and getting a job.
